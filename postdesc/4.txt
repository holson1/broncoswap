I got this book used from the bookstore and they wouldn't give me <br />
any money for it at the end of the quarter....<br />
<br />
I know for a fact that this book will be used next quarter, so why <br />
not buy it from me cheap? The cover and pages are a bit worn and <br />
marked-up, but you can still read it fine. Will also consider trades.
