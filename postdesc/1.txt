Hey, everybody!<br />
<br />
I bought this chair for my house last year, but I'm moving to a much <br />
smaller apartment and need to ditch some extraneous furniture. <br />
The chair is black and is very comfortable. It's great for a &quot;kitchen <br />
table&quot; chair but works well with a personal desk too. <br />
<br />
Asking price is $20 but I'm willing to negotiate. <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
Henry
